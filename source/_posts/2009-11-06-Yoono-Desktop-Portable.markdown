Here is a new Yoono feature that really need some emphasis!
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://blog.yoono.com/2009/10/get-yoono-desktop-to-go/" style="font-size: 1.5em">Yoono Desktop Portable</a></p>
<p>This new version allows you to launch the Yoono's social network aggregation
tool directly from a usb key. And the most important point is that your profile
is saved on it, so no personal data is saved in the computer you're using and
all your settings and socials updates travel with you.<br />
The icing on the cake is that it's even more &quot;portable&quot; than just that! You can
even launch this application on Windows <ins>AND</ins> MacOS!!!</p>
<p><strong>Only two steps to test this :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip <a href="http://cache.yoono.com/download/desktop/yoono-desktop-portable.zip">yoono-desktop-portable.zip</a>
somewhere on a usbkey</li>
<li>On windows, launch <em>&quot;Yoono Desktop Portable.exe&quot;</em></li>
<li>On macos, launch <em>&quot;Yoono Desktop Portable&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The only drawback is usb drive read/write performance. Depending on drive
model Yoono Desktop appears to take long time to load. But we are going to gain
a huge speed up with <a href="http://autonome.wordpress.com/tag/performance/">current work</a> on mozilla
platform about startup performance. So don't forget to check out yoono desktop
portable when Firefox 3.6 is out! (release planned before the end of the
year)</p>
