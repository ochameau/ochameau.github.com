Another day, another library!<br />
This new library brings some usefull functions and one of them is just awesome
:)<br />
Start with these usefull functions:
<ul>
<li>return the distance between two points,</li>
<li>retrieve the a point at a given distance between two another,</li>
<li>compute the square box with a given size around a point</li>
</ul>
And the awesome function allows you to find the point at a given duration on a
direction computed by google maps API. For example, you may retrieve the
precive point where you are going to be after 1hour driving on the road from
Paris to Berlin!<br />
For more information, I suggest you to check at the README available on github:
