As I'm hacking around Google Maps API, I tried to write some libraries around
it in order to ease futher developments around this very cool API! The first
library brings auto-suggest in html inputs, so users can see a dynamic list of
cities name when they start typing in a form :)<br />
<br />
Here is the source code of it, licenced under LGPL:<br />

And what users may expect: <img src="/public/gmaps/gmapi-suggest-sc1.png" alt="gmapi-suggest-sc1.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" title="gmapi-suggest-sc1.png, nov. 2010" /> <img src="/public/gmaps/gmapi-suggest-sc2.png" alt="gmapi-suggest-sc2.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" title="gmapi-suggest-sc2.png, nov. 2010" />
